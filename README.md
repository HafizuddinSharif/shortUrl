# Coin Gecko Software Engineering Task

## Setup

```
// ./client
npm install

// ./server
npm install

```

## Running the program

```
// ./client
npm run start

// ./server
npm run app
```

## The problem

I believe you should NOT be able to run the program because of the database can only be connected based on the IP address. During development, I only
allow my personal IP address to access it, so you might not be able to do so. This is an incomplete project as I do not have enough time to fully complete it due to
a lot of commitment I have at the moment.
